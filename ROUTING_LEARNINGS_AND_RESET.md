# Crime-Aware Routing System: Learnings and Repository Reset

## Executive Summary

After extensive experimentation with crime-aware routing algorithms in Toronto, we've accumulated significant learnings about what works, what doesn't, and how to build better systems. This document captures these insights before resetting the repository for a clean, optimized restart.

## Core Data Assets (KEEP)

### 1. Crime Data
- **File**: `Assault_Open_Data_-331273077107818534.geojson` (8.5MB)
- **Content**: 5,583 assault incidents with precise coordinates
- **Format**: GeoJSON with lat/lon coordinates
- **Coverage**: Toronto metropolitan area (43.5-44.0 lat, -79.0 to -80.0 lon)
- **Status**: ✅ CRITICAL - This is our primary data source

### 2. Essential Libraries and Dependencies
- **OSMnx**: For street network data from OpenStreetMap
- **NetworkX**: For graph algorithms and shortest path calculations  
- **Folium**: For interactive map visualization
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations (when used)
- **JSON**: For data serialization and caching

## Key Technical Learnings

### 🚀 What Worked Well

#### 1. Binary Search Penalty Optimization
- **Concept**: Use binary search to find optimal penalty scaling factors
- **Benefit**: Ensures routes stay within distance constraints while maximizing safety
- **Implementation**: Pre-calculate base penalties once, then scale them iteratively
- **Performance**: 5-10x faster than recalculating penalties each iteration

#### 2. Distance Constraint Framework
- **Approach**: Allow routes up to X% longer than shortest path (e.g., 20-50%)
- **User Control**: Single `MAX_DISTANCE_INCREASE` parameter for easy adjustment
- **Practical**: Prevents algorithms from finding impractically long "safe" routes

#### 3. Multi-Method Comparison
- **Value**: Different algorithms excel in different scenarios
- **Essential Methods**:
  - Exponential decay (smooth distance-based penalties)
  - Linear penalties (simpler, more predictable)
  - Threshold avoidance (binary safe/unsafe zones)
  - Raw data weighted (considers crime density)

#### 4. Pre-computation and Caching
- **Strategy**: Calculate base penalties once per network loading
- **Impact**: Massive performance improvements for iterative algorithms
- **Cache Structure**: Hash-based caching of network data and penalties

#### 5. Comprehensive Visualization
- **Maps**: Interactive Folium maps with crime incidents, routes, and legends
- **Overlays**: Heat maps showing crime density
- **Route Comparison**: Multiple colored routes with detailed statistics

### ⚠️ What Didn't Work / Problems Identified

#### 1. Over-Engineering and Feature Creep
- **Problem**: Started with 4 methods, ended with 8+ complex variations
- **Impact**: Code became unmaintainable, hard to debug
- **Lesson**: Focus on 2-3 core methods that work well

#### 2. Complex Binary Search Implementation
- **Problem**: Binary search logic became convoluted with too many edge cases
- **Issues**: Different scaling approaches for different methods, inconsistent behavior
- **Solution**: Simplify to one unified scaling approach

#### 3. Inefficient Route Statistics Calculation
- **Problem**: Crime exposure calculations were inconsistent across methods
- **Issues**: Some methods reported 0 crimes despite visible crime density
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between method naming conventions and statistics functions

#### 4. Street Name Limitations
- **Problem**: Most edges labeled as "unnamed" instead of proper street names
- **Impact**: Street-aware corridor routing was ineffective
- **Limitation**: OSMnx data quality varies by region

#### 5. Excessive File Generation
- **Problem**: Generated dozens of HTML files, cache files, benchmark reports
- **Impact**: Repository became cluttered and hard to navigate
- **Solution**: Generate files on-demand, clean up automatically

#### 6. Distance Calculation Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: Mixed use of weighted distances vs. actual geometric distances
- **Impact**: Routes appeared to have same distance when they were actually different
- **Fix**: Always use geometric distance for route length reporting

### 🔧 Technical Optimization Insights

#### 1. NumPy Vectorization Potential
- **Opportunity**: Crime distance calculations can be vectorized
- **Current**: Loop through all crimes for each edge (O(n*m) complexity)
- **Optimized**: Use NumPy arrays for batch distance calculations
- **Expected Gain**: 10-100x performance improvement for large datasets

#### 2. Spatial Indexing
- **Need**: Current crime lookups are inefficient
- **Solution**: Use spatial indices (R-tree, KD-tree) for nearest neighbor queries
- **Libraries**: `rtree`, `scipy.spatial.KDTree`
- **Impact**: Faster crime proximity calculations

#### 3. Network Preprocessing
- **Strategy**: Pre-calculate crime exposure for all edges in common areas
- **Storage**: Cache results in efficient format (HDF5, compressed JSON)
- **Benefit**: Near-instant route calculation after initial preprocessing

#### 4. Memory Management
- **Issue**: Large networks (>10k edges) cause memory pressure
- **Solutions**: 
  - Stream processing for large datasets
  - Only load edges within route bounding box + buffer
  - Use sparse data structures

### 2. Key Design Principles

#### Simplicity First
- **Start with 2 methods**: Exponential decay and linear penalty
- **One optimization approach**: Unified binary search constraint solving
- **Clear separation**: Data loading, algorithm logic, visualization

#### Performance by Design
- **NumPy vectorization**: Use arrays for all distance calculations
- **Lazy loading**: Only compute what's needed
- **Smart caching**: Cache preprocessed results, not intermediate steps

#### User-Friendly Interface
- **Single parameter control**: Distance constraint percentage
- **Clear output**: Distance, crime exposure, time trade-offs
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only essential libraries

## Specific Code Patterns That Worked

### 1. Distance Constraint Pattern
```python
# Good: Simple percentage-based constraint
MAX_DISTANCE_INCREASE = 0.3  # 30% longer than shortest
max_allowed_distance = shortest_distance * (1.0 + MAX_DISTANCE_INCREASE)
```

### 2. Pre-computation Pattern
```python
# Good: Calculate base penalties once
base_penalties = {}
for edge in edges:
    penalty = calculate_penalty(edge, crimes)
    base_penalties[edge] = penalty

# Then scale efficiently
for scaling_factor in search_range:
    apply_scaled_penalties(base_penalties, scaling_factor)
```

### 3. Clean Statistics Calculation
```python
# Good: Consistent distance and crime calculations
def calculate_route_stats(route_nodes, graph):
    distance = sum(graph[u][v]['length'] for u, v in route_edges)
    crime_exposure = sum(graph[u][v]['crime_count'] for u, v in route_edges)
    return {'distance': distance, 'crimes': crime_exposure}
```
